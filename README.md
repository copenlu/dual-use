## Dual Use Checklist

**Dual use of scientific artefacts**

-   *Did you explicitly outline the intended use of scientific artefacts
    you create?*

-   *Can any scientific artefacts you create be used for surveillance by
    companies or governmental institutions?*

-   *Can any scientific artefacts you create be used for military
    application?*

-   *Can any scientific artefacts you create be used to harm or oppress
    any and particularly marginalised groups of society?*

-   *Can any scientific artefacts you create be used to intentionally
    manipulate, such as spread disinformation or polarise people?*

**Prevention of dual use**

-   *Did you access your institution's or other available resources to
    ensure limiting the misuse of your research?*

-   *Have you been provided by your institution with ethics training
    that covered potential misuse of your research?*

-   *Were the scientific artefacts you created reviewed for dual use and
    approved by your institution's ethics board?*
